    <p>With the advent of new digital technologies, it is now possible to create architecture in new ways.</p>
    <p>In a digitized world, we no longer need real estate agents to look out for available plots of land for us, or architects to check on the local regulations and create a few conceptual designs for us. Instead, we use computers to deal with all that, and a beautiful website to present the results.</p>
    <p><em>It is as simple as that. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></em></p>
